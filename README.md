# Lightify

A plugin to flash your lights when you get mentioned on Discord

At this time, only YeeLight lights are supported. Lifx light support will be added in the future. Philips Hue unknown, I don't have that type of smart lighting. 

Make sure that you have LAN Control enabled in the YeeLight app, and take note of the light's IP address under device info, you will need it later. 


## Requirements

Requires python3 and the yeelight library. Lightify will display prompts if those are missing. 

## Installation 

cd yourpowercordinstall/src/Powercord/plugins

git clone https://github.com/GeoffreyWesthoff/lightify

Restart your Discord
